## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Plain CSS
- Responsive web design
- Javascript
- Restful API

### App Description

Random color generator is a simple app that uses a Restful API call to get random colors, with their hex values and display them on the page based on a selected base color and a color scheme. 

This helps developers and other color lovers to choose between a variety of random colors to use.

### Continued development
I am working on adding a feature that allows users to copy the returned color hex values by clicking on each color bar.
